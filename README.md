<h2> Important Note for me </h2>
<p> from this source https://investigate.ai/investigating-sentiment-analysis/designing-your-own-sentiment-analysis-tool/</p>
<p> It seems that SA tools provided by different modules does not agree with each other, and each tool is trained on different sets. </p>
<p> The best way may be to train my own model based on a selection of twitter posts </p>
<p> The link above have a tutorial on building a positive-negative sentiment analysis tool. But it does not include emotion. For emotion, NRC has a huge list of words associated with 8 emotions.</p>
<p> NRCLex does not work well with twitter (personal experience)</p>





<h3> Goal of this project </h3>
<p> Monitor regional reaction towards COVID-19 by analyzing sentiment from twitter posts. </p>
<p> <i> a simplified version of social opinion monitor? </i></p>
<p><i> or a covid-19 online reactions map </i> </p>

<h3> What it provides</h3>
<p> 1. an overall distribution of sentiment polarity (axis: positive/negative)</p>
<p> 2. histogram of emotions expressed in COVID-19 related posts</p>
<p> 3. frequent topics in COVID-19 related posts</p>
<p> 4. reaction forcast? </p>
<p> 5. sketch out a profile for high-risk groups? </p>

<h3> Possible usage</h3>
<p> 1. use it as a overview of how people react to COVID-19 online </p>
<p> 2. frequent topics in COVID-19 could reveal some of the major concerns that needs to be addressed</p>
<p> <i> 3. use as a research topic generator <s>for social science students</s></i> </p>
